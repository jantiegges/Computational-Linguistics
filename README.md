# Computational Linguistics

## Project Overview
This project is a collection of problem sets for a Computational Linguistics course. Each problem set is contained in its own directory and includes both the problem set itself and any associated tests. The problem sets are written in Clojure and contain exercises around the topics of regular expressions, finite-state automata, context-free grammars, parsing, and semantics. There is also a written report on each problem set, which contains further theoretical questions and explanations.

## Problem Sets
- [Problem Set 1](ps-1/ps1-tiegges-jan.clj)
- [Problem Set 2](ps-2/ps2-tiegges-jan.clj)
- [Problem Set 3](ps-3/ps3-tiegges-jan.clj)
- [Problem Set 4](ps-4/ps4-tiegges-jan.clj)
- [Problem Set 5](ps-5/ps5-tiegges-jan.tex)
- [Problem Set 6](ps-6/ps6-tiegges-jan.clj)

## Running the Tests
To run the tests for a problem set, open the corresponding test file and execute it in your Clojure environment.
